# Cursor-Hell

A bullet hell game made as a demonstration game for my 2D bullet hell engine, **CursEr**.  
The engine was in development since December 2021 but the game and most of the engine was made in 10 days for the **Bullet Hell Jam 2022**.


## CursEr

CursEr is my custom cross-platform OpenGL engine to make 2D Bullet Hell games.
It uses:
- GLFW for the window
- GLAD for the OpenGL functions
- GLM for OpenGL math
- SFML Audio for sounds and music

## Information - 2024-12-30

As previously mentioned, Cursor Hell was written in around 10 days.
The code is a mess and I didn't know how git worked so even the repo itself is a mess.

Also, this is not a game engine, this is just a game. Originally this was a game engine project,
which is why I mention a "game" and an "engine".

If you're looking for better and newer projects, check [Penumbra](https://github.com/A31Nesta/Penumbra) or [Occlusion](https://github.com/A31Nesta/Occlusion):
a 2D and 3D Renderer and the game engine that uses it.

If the link for Occlusion doesn't work it's because I put the link before it's even public so
that I don't need to update this page when I publish the engine :P
