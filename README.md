# Cursor-Hell

A bullet hell game made as a demonstration game for my 2D bullet hell engine, **CursEr**.  
The engine was in development since December 2021 but the game and most of the engine was made in 10 days for the **Bullet Hell Jam 2022**.


## CursEr

CursEr is my custom cross-platform OpenGL engine to make 2D Bullet Hell games.
It uses:
- GLFW for the window
- GLAD for the OpenGL functions
- GLM for OpenGL math
- SFML Audio for sounds and music
